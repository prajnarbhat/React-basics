1. so we have a property needs to be added to one specific Book
2. We need to add descripton to a particular Book
3. That time we use childer
4. Also when we write any content inside the coponent tag that is
        <Book title="abc"> Desc inside component tag </Book>
        here titles are attribute5. 
5. To access the content inside component tag we use the keyword children

function Booklist(){
    <Book title="abc"/>
    <Book title="abz"> <p>I am book2</p> </Book>
}

function Book(title,children // here children nothing but content inside them){
    <h1>{title}</h1>
    {children}
}
