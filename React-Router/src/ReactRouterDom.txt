1.In our application there will be multiple pages, how to navigate to different pages
2.React-router-dom
3.npm install react-router-dom

4.Create a home page,about and contact page
5.App.js will be parent
6.localhost:3000/about needs to go to about page
7.import import { BrowserRouter as Router,Route } from "react-router-dom";
8.Include all components inside Router
9.<Route path="/"  when goest / it needs to go to element={Home}

Router-link:
To navigate from one page to another page through application
for that use link
import Link
Link has a parameter to which says to which page it sould navigate

Router-Switch
localhost:3000/hello there is np page called hello which will give white space
So we need error page
We will create route for it, then path for that route is * means all paths



wrap our content first with <BrowserRouter>.
Then we define our <Routes>. An application can have multiple <Routes>. Our basic example only uses one.
