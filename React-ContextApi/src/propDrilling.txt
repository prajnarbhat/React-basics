// 1.Props drilling is the way we pass the data from the parent component
to all nested child component through multiple layers, wven though some components do not need the data

// So when have data in app which needs to a particular component like grandchild of that app

// We have a context api where we can pass the data through the component tree without having to pass the props manually at each level

1. Create a createContext object
2. Create a provider component => This will provide the context value to its children
3.useContext hook => allow to consume the context
