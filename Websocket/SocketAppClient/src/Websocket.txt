HTTP:
1.It is a stateless unidireactional that is clent send a request server
will provide a response again if we need a new data again the client
will need to send the request
2.Problem: chatting appl will lead into issue while getting data everytime is diificult

But first request from client to server is an http, then server give a response and the handhsake will be completed
In this single connetction it can send and get data
Websocket can send request at any time
It is statefull and bidrectional and fullduplex(same time client and server can talk)
